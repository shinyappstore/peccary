# peccary: Streamlinie Key Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamics Analysis

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/peccary](https://shinyappstore.com/a/peccary)__

peccary is an user-friendly application designed for streamlined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics analysis. Built on the powerful peccary R package, this tool enhances Pharmacometrics efficiency. Pharmacometrics involves the quantitative analysis of drug properties and their interactions with biological systems. peccary facilitates graphical exploration of datasets, supports non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis, and provides inputs for both model development and simulation. With a robust and easy-to-use interface, peccary aims to improve user experience. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis involves the calculation of drug exposure metrics without assuming a specific compartmental model. While working with peccary is optional, it proves time-saving, and the application stores pathways of previous projects for quick access. This feature ensures that users can efficiently retrieve information from past analyses, reducing the need for repetitive actions.
